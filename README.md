# Credit Card Payment Delay Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to address the concern of potential credit card payment delays at FinanKu, which can negatively impact the business. By predicting individuals who are likely to experience payment delays, FinanKu can develop timely strategies to mitigate future risks.

## Problem Statement
There is a concern about the possibility of credit card payment delays at FinanKu, which could harm the business. Therefore, it is crucial to predict individuals who have the potential to experience payment delays as early as possible to devise appropriate strategies for future conditions.

## Objective
Develop a model that can predict at least 60% of customers who will experience credit card payment delays, achieving an accuracy and recall rate of over 60%.

## Available Variables
The dataset contains the following variables:

1. **Customer ID**: Unique ID of the customer
2. **Branch**: Location of the branch where the customer is registered
3. **City**: City where the customer is registered
4. **Age**: Age of the customer during the observation period
5. **Avg. Annual Income/Month**: Average monthly income of the customer in a year
6. **Balance (Q1-Q4)**: Customer's end-of-quarter balance
7. **Num of Products (Q1-Q4)**: Number of products owned by the customer at the end of the quarter
8. **HasCrCard (Q1-Q4)**: Status of credit card ownership at the end of the quarter
9. **Active Member (Q1-Q4)**: Customer's active status at the end of the quarter
10. **Unpaid Tagging**: Status of the customer's payment delay

## Methodology
To achieve the objective, the following steps will be taken:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the data distribution and identifying patterns.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features and selecting the most relevant ones for the model.
4. **Model Selection**: Evaluating various machine learning models to find the best fit.
5. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Training the selected model and evaluating its performance based on accuracy and recall.
